A Desert is 1000KM long. A Camel and 3000 bananas are there at one end. You have to get as many bananas as possible to the other end by carrying them on that camel.
Camel constraints...
1) It will eat 1 banana for each kilometer even if it is not carrying any bananas(i.e it needs one banana for just to walk 1km)
2) It cannot carry more than 1000 bananas
